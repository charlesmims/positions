positions
=========

Stock Portfolio tool


This is a work in progress.  I'm learning ruby and thought this would be a fun way to get some experince with that.
Currently it has some stocks bought at a certain price hard coded into positions.rb, and a tests file
that needs to be updated. 
Ideas for improvements: 
[ ] move tracked positions into a db file
[ ] track historical pricing data in a db file
[ ] add twitter feed and NLP sentiment rating for each symbol
[ ] scrape target pricing from web articles
[ ] fundamentals
